        <ol>
            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium heat 
                until just bubbling. Add the sausage, then season with salt. 
                Brown for 2 minutes on one side, 
                then stir and brown on the other side for 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, season with salt, and cook for 2 minutes, 
                until starting to soften. 
                Add the jalapeño, garlic, and tomato paste. 
                Stir to distribute the tomato paste. 
                Add the Jazzy spice blend and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta, red and green peppers, mushrooms, 
                and salt and stir to combine. 
                Pour in the tomatoes and stock. 
                Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10-12 minutes, until the pasta is cooked through and the peppers are tender but not mushy.</li>
            <li>Mix in the cream cheese to create a thick, creamy sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve garnished with scallions, if desired.</li>
